SOLID are five design principles used to make your software design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They could be used in any OOP language. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one responsibility, and there should be only a single reason to change it.

2. O - Open Closed Principle: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle: A child class should be substitutable for its parent class without breaking the behavior of our code.

4. I - Interface Segregation Principle: An interface should only have methods that apply to all child classes.

5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle: A class should depend on abstraction (interface and abstract class) not of concrete implementations.
